       "'THE GREAT QUESTION OF CITIZENSHIP  \\nBEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday that there is “no disagreement” between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping over North Korea. Xi shared with Trump specific actions that China is taking to enforce sanctions against North Korea, such as restrictions on bank accounts, Tillerson told reporters in Beijing. Both leaders will not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea, he added.     Trump arrived in the Chinese capital on Wednesday from South Korea as part of a marathon Asia tour where he has received a lavish welcome from Xi, including a personal tour of the Forbidden City. \\nHuckabee s not hiding his frustration with Trump s potential pick for Secretary of State. He tells Fox and Friends he believes thinks if Trump chooses Mitt Romney, it would be  a real insult  to those who voted for him. It s not about that I don t care for Mitt personally but I m still very unhappy that Mitt did everything he could to derail Donald Trump. He didn t just go after him from a standpoint that I disagree with his policy on immigration or I disagree with his policy on taxes. He attacked him on a personal level on his character and integrity  And so it would be a real insult to all those Donald Trump voters who worked really hard. That s what I believe he has to stop and consider.

The choice for the secretary of state position has been delayed by an internal struggle between the supporters of Romney, and those suggesting the  former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

In response to Trump s and Cruz s draconian calls to suppress Muslims, Bernie said: I think people get afraid, and for good reasons. ISIS is a disgusting, barbaric organization. We ve seen what they ve done in Paris, what they ve done in Brussels. People are afraid of an attack in the United States. But I think what we have to understand is we re not going to undermine the Constitution of the United States of America in order to effectively destroy ISIS. At the end of the day, we cannot allow the Trumps of the world to use these incidents to attack all of the Muslim people in the world. That is unfair. To imply that if somebody is a Muslim they re a terrorist, that is an outrageous statement.Watch Video Here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNJs_rqboBQ]On a lighter note, when Sanders appeared on Kimmel back in October, Kimmel said that he thought to himself: This is a very smart guy, he has some very interesting ideas, he obviously loves his country, but there s no way we ll still be seeing him in March.  And yet here you are. Are you surprised by this? Yes and no,  Sanders said, discussing why Americans found his ideas attractive including uplifting the middle class and pushing for free tuition for college students at public institutions.America needs more politicians like Sanders, because honesty and integrity are a rarity these days.Featured image via video screenshot.\\nThis is hysterical! CNN asks a Trump supporter the wrong question and they get an earful   Awesome! \\nDonald Trump is obsessed with himself. So obsessed that he covers his wall with covers of magazines and newspapers that have his face on them, because  it s cheaper than wallpaper.  Well just recently The Crusader, the KKK s official newspaper, has endorsed Trump. Do you think that ll make it up on his wall? Or does he not  know anything about them?  In the past when talk of David Duke and the KKK endorsing Trump was circulating he claimed to know nothing about them. Shouldn t someone who s the potential president of the United States know what the KKK is? You can see more on that here:So while Donald Trump claims to have know idea who the Klu Klux Klan is, there have been ties from Trump s inner circle to the KKK. With his support taking a sharp nosedive in the polls, it s not hard to imagine him accepting support from just about anybody. Or maybe this time he ll pretend he doesn t know what the KKK is again.\\nTed Cruz provided a funny moment during the Republican debate last night: \\nWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Republicans in the U.S. Congress rush to finish their tax plan, the legislation is not getting more popular with the public, with nearly half of Americans still opposed to it, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Monday. Of adults who were aware of the plan being considered by Congress, 49 percent said they were opposed to it, a sentiment that has not changed much in the past few weeks, the poll showed. In addition to the 49 percent who said they opposed the Republican tax bill, 31 percent said they supported it and 20 percent said they “don’t know,” according to the online opinion poll of 1,499 adults conducted Dec. 3 to 7, with 1,138 adults saying they were aware of the tax legislation. A poll taken at the end of November also showed 49 percent opposed to the plan.  Tax negotiators are trying to reconcile the differences between separate bills passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate, then to send a final bill to President Donald Trump, who want to sign it into law before year’s end. Accomplishing this feat would represent the Republicans’ first major legislative victory since they took control of both chamber of Congress and the White House in January. Republican tax legislation would slash the corporate tax rate, eliminate some taxes paid only by rich Americans and offer a mixed bag of temporary cuts to other individuals and families. Trump, who is expected to give a speech on the tax overhaul on Wednesday, praised it in a tweet on Sunday by saying the “end result will be not only important, but SPECIAL!” When asked about Trump’s handling of tax policy, 53 percent of those polled said they disapproved, 38 percent approved and 9 percent said they “don’t know,” the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed. When asked who stands to benefit most from the Republican plan, more than half of American adults surveyed selected either the wealthy or large U.S. corporations. Twelve percent chose “all Americans,” 8 percent picked the middle class and 2 percent chose lower-income Americans. The Reuters/Ipsos poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 about percentage points. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll released on Sunday showed that 32 percent of Americans support the Republican tax plan, with more than half predicting it would not lower tax bills for their families or help the economy in a major way.\\nHere s a question for the anti-Trump media: If Putin and Trump have such a strong history of working together, why take such drastic actions against the US? Why doesn t Putin just pick up the phone and call his old buddy Donald Trump and get those sanctions lifted? Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday that 755 US diplomats must leave the country by Sept. 1.Putin s order comes after a threat he issued on Friday about slashing US diplomatic staff in Russia and seizing two American properties in retaliation after Congress approved a vote to slap new sanctions over Moscow s interference in the 2016 presidential election.Remember when President Trump used Twitter to mock the media for suggesting Putin wanted to see Trump elected over the very weak Hillary Clinton?In other words, Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election   and why not, I want strong military & low oil prices. Witch Hunt! https://t.co/mMSxj4Su5z  Donald J.

ORB International said 66 percent of people disapproved of the government s conduct of the negotiations, up from 64 percent last month.  The poll also showed only 27 percent were confident that May will get the right deal, compared with 47 percent who were not confident. Trust in May s handling of Brexit has evaporated since she gambled away her parliamentary majority in an election in June. With only 17 months left until Britain is due to exit the European Union, the lack of clear progress in the negotiations has raised fears of an abrupt departure with no transition that businesses say they need. For the first time, more Britons disagreed that Brexit will help the economy than agreed, ORB said.  There is no sign that the prime minister is beginning to turn things around when it comes to Brexit,  ORB said in a statement.  Overall these poll findings provide little encouragement for a prime minister facing multiple battles.  As well as trying to breath life into Brexit talks, May is dealing with a growing sexual harassment scandal in Britain s parliament. Without an overall majority, May cannot afford to lose parliamentary seats.  Businesses have expressed alarm at the progress of Brexit talks. On Monday, the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply said nearly two-thirds of European businesses planned to cut back orders from British suppliers. Last month finance minister Philip Hammond said a transition deal needed to be struck by early 2018.

Publicly, U.S. President Donald Trump, his top aides and senior Saudi officials have hailed what they say is a major improvement in U.S.-Saudi ties compared with relations under former President Barack Obama, who upset the Saudis by sealing a nuclear deal with their arch-foe Iran. However, U.S. diplomats and intelligence analysts privately express anxiety over some of the more hawkish actions by Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, especially towards Yemen, Qatar and Lebanon, as Saudi Arabia seeks to contain Iranian influence.  With respect to Saudi Arabia s engagement with Qatar, how they re handling the Yemen war that they re engaged in, the Lebanon situation, we would encourage them to be a bit more measured and a bit more thoughtful in those actions to, I think, fully consider the consequences,  Tillerson told a news conference alongside his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian. In Yemen, Riyadh is leading an Arab military coalition against the Houthi movement that controls the capital. In recent weeks it imposed a blockade of ports, threatening to worsen what the United Nations says could become one of the worst famines in modern times. Saudi Arabia has also led neighboring Gulf Arab countries this year in cutting off trade and diplomatic ties with their neighbor Qatar, which Riyadh says supports terrorism. Qatar is an important American ally and home to a big U.S. air base. A month ago, the prime minister of Lebanon announced he was resigning while on a visit to Saudi Arabia. He returned home two weeks later and withdrew his resignation last week, drawing a line under the episode. Tillerson s comments were the latest sign of U.S. concern over aspects of the kingdom s foreign policy after Trump on Wednesday issued a one-paragraph statement demanding the Saudis allow immediate humanitarian aid to reach the Yemeni people. Although the blockade showed signs of breaking this week, Yemen s situation remains dire. About 8 million people are on the brink of famine with outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria.  We have called for a complete end of the blockade in Yemen and the opening of all ports. We are asking Saudi Arabia to allow that access,  Tillerson said. Tillerson s comments appear to be the first time the United States had publicly linked Saudi Arabia to the political crisis that broke out in Lebanon after Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation last month in Riyadh.  I think as to Lebanon, things have worked out in a very positive way,  Tillerson said.  Perhaps even more positive than before, because there have been very strong statements of affirmation for Lebanon, which will only be helpful.  Tillerson s rebuke comes at a time when Washington needs support from its major Arab ally, after Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel earlier this week.  When asked whether there was room for Palestinians also to achieve their goal of having part of Jerusalem as their capital, Tillerson emphasized that Trump s move was not intended to shut down their demands over the city.  In fact, he was very clear, I think, the final status of Jerusalem, including the borders, would be left to the parties to negotiate and decide,  Tillerson said.\\nFareed Zakaria tends to go for the heart of the matter when he s talking about pretty much anything, but it s not likely that anybody expected him to criticize Donald Trump as bluntly as he did. Zakaria was live on CNN, speaking with Wolf Blitzer about what it says when a presidential candidate has to come back, time and again, to clarify what he says on volatile issues like Russia.Zakaria explained that there s a pattern of ignorance with Trump, and how, when someone points out that he s wrong somewhere, he comes back  with a certain bravado and tries to explain it away with a tweet or a statement.  He listed multiple examples of this, such as Brexit, the nuclear triad, and even where Tim Kaine was governor (Trump said New Jersey; Kaine actually governed Virginia). Then he said: Usually he adds that the press hates him. But there s a term for this kind of thing   This is the mode of a bullshit artist. DAMN. There s a truth bomb if there ever was one. Trump is, indeed, a bullshit artist   there s no other way to put it.

On platforms such as the Twitter-like Sina Weibo, Trump s Chinese supporters, who admire his business success and a free-wheeling style unconstrained by political correctness, are far more prominent than detractors. While no comprehensive survey has been done to assess the size and intensity of Trump s popularity in China, several pundits suggest he has broad and vocal support.  Chinese people are impressed that he is extremely rich, he loves things splendid and magnificent, and he loves to show off. Not every billionaire is like that,  said Yin Hao, who translates American news and comedy clips for his nearly one million followers on Weibo.     Yin said his translated Trump-related video clips sometimes attract thousands of comments, where some supporters engage in name-calling and invective in defending the president.  They will keep posting comments to defend Trump, mock his opponents under all news clips that involve Trump, and rebuke any comments that are not in favor of Trump,  Yin said. Chen Jibing, a Shanghai-based political commentator, said Trump s Chinese fan base is different than that for previous foreign leaders such as his predecessor, Barack Obama, and for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who enjoyed widespread but tepid support.  Chinese Trump fans are seriously and truly invested, and you had better not make light of offending them,  Chen wrote in a social media post to his millions of followers. While Trump encountered protests during his visits to Japan and South Korea on the first two legs of his 12-day Asian tour, such scenes are unlikely in China, which tightly controls public gatherings, with media and the internet subject to censorship. China s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said Trump will receive a  state visit-plus  experience in Beijing. He is expected to go to the Forbidden City and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details. Trump s popularity in China largely comes from his disdain for political correctness and defiance of traditional liberal western views, which many Chinese consider elitist and unrealistic, Chen said. His criticism of the U.S. trade deficit with China, for example, is seen by many in the country as standard U.S. political talk, some pundits say.     In China, realists hold a deep-rooted belief that the rule of the jungle means the strong prey on the weak,  Chen said.  For them, the world is not split into right and wrong, good or evil, it is only success or failure, the powerful and the weak.   Factual errors or gaffes by Trump tend to be ignored by his Chinese fans or explained away as harmless mistakes made by a leader who writes his own rules. In Japan on Monday, Trump told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the Japanese economy was not performing as well as the United States  and appeared to mistakenly say that Japan s economy was the world s second-largest. It is actually third, after China s. An editor at a major state publication told Reuters was inclined to be forgiving about Trump s remark to Abe:  He s a free spirit. No one can tell him what to do.    Many on Chinese social media see Trump as a figure of fun.  Rather than being a president, Trump is more like a comedian!  one Weibo user wrote. In a country where parents are traditionally judged by the success of their children, Trump scores extra points for his daughter Ivanka, a businesswoman and currently advisor to President Trump, and her Mandarin-speaking children. One Chinese state publication said that all five of Trump s children are a testament to his character.  You can tell what parents are like through their childrens  success. Trump s five children are all excellent, it means he is a very successful father,  the China Education Daily said on its social media account. Ivanka Trump is sometimes referred to as  goddess  on Chinese social media, where some were upset that the first daughter would not be accompanying her father to Beijing.  SAD! Ivanka is not coming to China,  said Jiang Xiaofeng, a journalist with Phoenix TV on Sina Weibo, appropriating one of Donald Trump s favorite Twitter exclamations.\\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday that Germany would stand by U.N. resolutions on the Israel-Palestinian conflict after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  We re sticking to the relevant U.N. resolutions - they make clear that the status of Jerusalem needs to be negotiated as part of negotiations on a two-state solution for Israel and that s why we want this process to be revived,  she said. On Wednesday Merkel had already said Germany does not support the Trump administration s decision. \\nScott Adams, who s best known as the creator of the Dilbert cartoon, is endorsing Hillary Clinton, but not because he agrees with her policies, or even because he likes her. He s endorsing her because he believes, somewhere in his twisted little mind, that he ll be murdered if he doesn t.In his blog (did you know there was a Dilbert blog?), he says that his politics don t match up with any of the candidates, but he does credit Trump with  extraordinary persuasion skills.  It gets worse, and don t feel bad if you have trouble keeping up with his theory.This past week we saw Clinton pair the idea of President Trump with nuclear disaster, racism, Hitler, the Holocaust, and whatever else makes you tremble in fear.The only downside I can see to the new approach is that it is likely to trigger a race war in the United States. And I would be a top-ten assassination target in that scenario because once you define Trump as Hitler, you also give citizens moral permission to kill him. And obviously it would be okay to kill anyone who actively supports a genocidal dictator, including anyone who wrote about his persuasion skills in positive terms. (I m called an  apologist  on Twitter, or sometimes just Joseph Goebbels).If Clinton successfully pairs Trump with Hitler in your mind   as she is doing   and loses anyway, about a quarter of the country will think it is morally justified to assassinate their own leader. I too would feel that way if an actual Hitler came to power in this country. I would join the resistance and try to take out the Hitler-like leader. You should do the same. No one wants an actual President Hitler.Then, it gets even weirder. Adams predicts that Trump will win in a landslide, but he believes that by endorsing Clinton, he will insulate himself from any backlash, because, according to Adams, one of the first people targeted when people try to assassinate Trump, will be the creator of Dilbert.So I ve decided to endorse Hillary Clinton for President, for my personal safety. Trump supporters don t have any bad feelings about patriotic Americans such as myself, so I ll be safe from that crowd. But Clinton supporters have convinced me   and here I am being 100% serious   that my safety is at risk if I am seen as supportive of Trump. So I m taking the safe way out and endorsing Hillary Clinton for president.Uh huh. So, that would be a backdoor endorsement of Trump. Believe us when we say, Scott Adams, if Trump is elected, you ll likely be one of the last people anyone thinks about.Featured image via YouTube video screen shot.\\nLAS VEGAS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump retains confidence in Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Wednesday. “As we’ve said many times before, if the president doesn’t have confidence in somebody, that person will not remain in that position,” Sanders told reporters on Air Force One.  She said Trump and Tillerson had not spoken on Wednesday. \\nThe bashing of Donald Trump is getting so old and tiresome. People with common sense know the truth and know what the left is trying to do. It s the same old playbook of demonizing what you don t like repeatedly.

You d think the liberals are all coordinating their talking points .hummm  Billy Crystal bashed Trump during his eulogy of Ali in a line similar to Clinton s speech on Tuesday: life is best when you build bridges between people, not walls. Do you think for one minute that Trump would have gotten where he is if he d not reached out to people and built bridges literally and figuratively? The reason Trump wants to build a literal wall with Mexico is that,  without borders, we don t have a country . We can certainly reach out to others but Trump knows open borders DO NOT WORK! Just take a look at Europe and the EU! What a mess! Trump has said he wants LEGAL IMMIGRATION and doesn t want ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION! He s protecting the people of America and that s putting America first!The problem with Billy Crystal s swipe at Trump is that he isn t practicing what he preaches. Anyone who knows Los Angeles knows that the homes have gates and walls. Well, Billy Crystal has walls and a fence surrounding his home people in glass houses!It was easy to get photos above of the fence and wall around Billy Crystal s home but we can t just walk onto his property uninvited. Isn t that the same as people walking over our border illegally?Comedian Billy Crystal gave an emotional tribute during Muhammad Ali s funeral on Friday, but may have sneaked in a low-key dig at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Crystal, a friend of The Champ s for more than 40 years, said at the end of his eulogy for the boxer in the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville, Kentucky that Ali  taught us that life is best when you build bridges between people, not walls.  That line Crystal said sounds similar to what Hillary Clinton said during her victory speech on Tuesday.  We believe that cooperation is better than conflict, unity is better than division, empowerment is better than resentment, and bridges are better than walls,  the Democratic presidential candidate front-runner said.

The media branch of the Republican party will pretty much always show bias towards any Republican candidate or conservative ideal. Most of the time even without trying to find any facts of any kind.However, it looks as though Trump is going to hate the new poll that Fox News revealed showing who, according to them and their viewers, won the first presidential debate.Winning with 61% of viewers polled was none other than Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.In fact, Trump was only able to garner 21% of those polled to say that he won, with 12% saying it was a tie.New Fox Poll: Who won first debate? #SpecialReport https://t.co/lmsmO06yfj pic.twitter.com/coMvS84lCj  Fox News (@FoxNews) September 30, 2016If you re any good at math, that s not even close. Not even remotely close. Hillary got well more than half of those polled saying that she definitively won, while Trump probably held onto the few who were going to say that he won no matter what.The bar is set so incredibly low for Trump, too. If he kept his pants on, those 21% pulling for Trump were still going to say that he won. So, for Hillary to sweep up this debate as a win in her column with even Fox News viewers, well, that s bad news for Trump and his floundering campaign.It will be interesting to see how he behaves in the next debate to try to sway viewers.Featured Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images, Twitter\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWbYpIj7CQ8\\n21st Century Wire says Is Donald Trump the answer?

      "* **Media Bias & Manipulation:** There’s a strong current of concern about media bias, particularly from Fox News. The text highlights how the media actively supports Trump and how polls can be manipulated to create a false impression of support (e.g., the manipulated Fox News poll results).  The mention of David Icke and Luke Rudkowski’s conversation further emphasizes skepticism towards mainstream media narratives.\n",
      "* **Backlash Against Trump's Tactics:** The text shows a significant backlash against Trump’s policies and rhetoric. The “Latinos for Trump” signs are repeatedly mocked as inauthentic and a cynical attempt to exploit racial divisions. The criticism of Billy Crystal’s speech reflects a broader rejection of Trump’s populist messaging.\n",
      "* **Distrust of Political Figures & Institutions:**  A recurring thread is a general distrust of political figures, particularly Hillary Clinton. The assertion that she’s “demonizing” her opponents and the focus on her campaign contributions fuel a narrative of corruption and hidden agendas.\n",
      "* **The Illusion of Support:** There's a persistent feeling that Trump's supporters are often acting based on appearances, rather than genuine belief. This is evidenced by the staged “Latinos for Trump” signs and the perception that people are backing him out of fear or a desire to avoid conflict.\n",
      "* **The Search for Explanation:**  Several pieces of text, like the “Who in the world is still supporting her?” reflection, demonstrate a genuine attempt to understand why individuals continue to support Trump despite apparent flaws and controversies.\n",
